Hi, Iâ€™m @Toonba, I'm a graduate of master's degree in chemistry who decided to change is career path to learn how to code. 

I learned to code thank to this class [OpenClassroom JavaScript - react developper class](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react)
