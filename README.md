Hi, Iâ€™m @Toonba, I graduated of master's degree in chemistry in 2019 and decided to change my career path in 2022 to learn how to code. 

I learned to code thank to this class [OpenClassroom JavaScript - react developper class](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react).

I am fascinated by the blockchain and its possibilities.  That's why My short-term goal is to train more and gain experience, and then in the long term, I aspire to develop innovative blockchain applications.
